# cv-site

Hello friends!!!

Here is the source for my cv, which can be found at mmmikem.github.io

I wrote this using preact and typescript, built with vite and tailwindcss for that insanely fast build time (141ms on my machine)

The key objective here was to build the most lightweight page possible, so some compomises have been made, specifically around routing and other general niceties.

I've tried to add some comments around things that I find interesting, I hope you find them interesting too! Feel free to shoot me questions about anything you see!
